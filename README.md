## Calculate BMI

Create a function called calculateBMI that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. The BMI is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = weight / (height * height)

where weight is the person's weight in kilograms and height is the person's height in meters.

##### Your Task ðŸ˜ƒ:

1. The function should take in two arguments:
* weight (a number): representing the weight of the person in kilograms
* height (a number): representing the height of the person in meters
The function should return the BMI calculated as per the above formula.
2. Call the function twice once for `Ali` and store his BMI in a varaible and once for `Mohamed` and store his BMI in a variable
3. Compare the BMI of `Mohamed` and `Ali` and log who's BMI is higher

Good Luck ðŸ˜€
