## Rock paper scissors

A simple rock paper scissors exercise

##### Your Task ðŸ˜ƒ:
Write a function called `playGame` that takes two parameters, `player1` and `player2`, representing the choices of two players in a game of rock, paper, scissors. The function should return a string indicating the winner of the game, or "tie" if the players chose the same option. Use logical operators to check the possible outcomes of the game.

#### Example
playGame("rock", "paper"); // should return "player2 wins"
playGame("scissors", "scissors"); // should return "tie"

Good Luck ðŸ˜€
